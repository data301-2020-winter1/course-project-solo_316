## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

{The topic goes into detail about income in America giving different information about each individual and their income. the information it gives on each individual is age, workclass, education level, marital status occupation realationship, race, sex, hours per week of work, and so on. The main distinction it marks based on their income is whether or not the individual has an income greater than or less than 50k a year.  I hope to learn more about income in america as well as the different factors and correlations i can make in the data set. I am interested in the opportunities that the data set presents in relation to the different categories that are available to interpret. Building a user facing dashboard with this data set will be very interesting and give me a challenge.      }
